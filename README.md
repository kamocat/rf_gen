# RF Generator
500W RF generator, tuned for 13.56MHz
Based on the paper [1kW Wideband Class E Power Amplifier](https://superlab.stanford.edu/publication/kw_mhz_wideband_class_e_power_amplifier_jiale/) from the Stanford Superlab.

I removed the duplicate circuit (for simplicity), added a FET driver, clock, and Arduino for control.
